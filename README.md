# xcmsrocker

Rocker image for metabolomics data analysis

For Java, you could select [MSDK](https://msdk.github.io/).

For C/C++, you could select [openms](https://www.openms.de/) or [ProteoWizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/).

For C#, you could select [Prime](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/).

For Matlab, you could select [Bioinformatics Toolbox](https://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/4347#).

For python, you could select [emzed](http://emzed.ethz.ch/index.html) or [TinyMS](https://github.com/griquelme/tidyms).

However, I suggest this R-based image for starter and hopefully we could see a Julia platform in the future. 

Same software is not the end and detailed workflow would be the key to reproducible research in metabolomics studies. Xcmsrocker is a linux based docker image to simply the usage of R based metabolomics software. It includes multiple mainstream R packages used in metabolomics study with RStduio as IDE. Such image could be easy deployed on single machine or clusters on the go. To make the users do the right thing for metabolomics studies, rmwf package is attached in this image to provide detailed workflow template( File - New File - R Markdown - From Template - Select template with {rmwf}) and facilitate the users to make metabolomics data analysis and/or comparison on the gaints' shoulder. Specifically, paired mass distances dependant analysis (PMDDA) and reactomics analysis templeates could be found here.

Here is a nice [review](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/metaRbolomics-book/) on R package for metabolomics.

[patRoon](https://github.com/rickhelmus/patRoon) is a similar project.

[MetaboAnalystR](https://github.com/xia-lab/MetaboAnalystR) R functions for MetaboAnalyst and they maintain [docker image](https://github.com/xia-lab/MetaboAnalyst_Docker) officially.

## Workflow template usage

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run Docker in your system

2. Pull the Rocker image `docker pull yufree/xcmsrocker:latest`

3. Use `docker run -e PASSWORD=xcmsrocker -p 8787:8787 yufree/xcmsrocker` to start the image

4. Open the browser and visit http://localhost:8787 or http://[your-ip-address]:8787 to power on RStudio server

5. Default user name is `rstudio` and password is `xcmsrocker`

6. Enjoy your data analysis! If you perferred to try PMDDA workflow, do the following step in RStudio:

- Go to File - New File - Rmarkdown... 
- Click 'From Template'
- Choose 'PMDDA Metabolomics Workflow' and click OK
- You will see a Rmd file with PMDDA data analysis script.

Step 2-6 could be visualized:
